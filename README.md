experiments on nmf and sparse convex autoencoding

We use the ionosphere dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere) to test 
the efficacy of a new algorithm for sparse convex autoencoding described in the following paper:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02574

We then compare this algorithm with standard algorithms for convex NMF.
