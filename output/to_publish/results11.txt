- results of applying the algorithms on mnist1-deskewed data
- surprisingly we don't see an improvement in compression or sparsity (there is slight worsening of both).
However, we can now visualize the reconstruction process properly (without the error that a digit is reconstructed using some other digits)
- also included are results of applying the algos on NYC_SAT_2010 dataset
