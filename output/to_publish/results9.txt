- randomized -> choose a random subset of the data as the dictionary and then use one of dp, dl, or dch for sparse coding
- We choose the dictionary size(k) for randomized algo to be equal to the size learned by our dictionary learning algorithms (dp, dl,
or dch) for comparison (based on table1.xlsx results a.k.a results7.xlsx)
- In general, we see randomized perform worse than others - doesn't meet the final cost constraint or if it meets then the compression
and sparsity is worse. However, a few cases where it is performing better (surprising!).
